Ocean acidification is the reduction of the pH of the ocean as a result 
of increased amounts of carbon dioxide. The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere and influences the sea surface temperature. Rising 
sea surface temperatures are problematic because it will create more 
atmospheric water vapor and decrease biodiversity because certain species 
need specific conditions in order to survive. The ocean is considered a 
carbon sink because phytoplankton absorb as much carbon as plants. As 
carbon dioxide emissions increase as a result of anthropogenic 
activities, increased amounts will be absorbed by the ocean. Ocean 
acidification is problematic because the acid breaks down calcium 
carbonate shells of marine creatures. This is problematic for communities 
that depend on the ocean for their livelihoods. We will examine the 
relationship between the pH of the ocean and sea surface temperature to 
determine how these factors influence each other.
