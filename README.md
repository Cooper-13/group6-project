Research Question:

We would like to research the connection between ocean surface temperature and ocean acidity. We will focus on the North Pacific Seashore region, particularly the Oregon, Washington, Vancouver Coast and Shelf, the Aleutian Islands, and the Southern California Bight. We will use resources from Integrated Ocean Observing System Partners Across Coasts Ocean Acidification (IPACOA) as our source for ocean acidification data points and resources from the USGS Western Fisheries Research Center and US EPA Western Ecology Division as our source for ocean surface temperature data. Using these data points, we will discover a link between ocean surface temperature and ocean acidity, if one exists. IPACOA provides other useful information, like chlorophyll concentration in water, and we will check correlations between that and sea surface temperature too.
