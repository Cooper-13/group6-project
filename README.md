# Group 6: Cooper Gottfried, Ben Breslow, Rina Goldberg
Our hypothesis is that Temperature and pH will be inversely related to each other. This is because warmer water leads to more dissociation of ions and can hold less CO2, which by CO2 + H20 -> H2CO3 creates carbonic acid, both of which increases the pH of sea water. We hypothesize that as Temperature increases, the pH will drop, and as Temperature decreases, the pH will increase. Our next steps are put the data into Python or R, remove all missing data and outliers (some measurements were not taken and show up as very large or small numbers), then analyze the data and perform statistical and visual analysis divided among our group members. Ben will be doing the data cleaning and processing, Rina the visualization and Cooper the statistical analysis.
